Question: Which galaxy renderings incorporate atypical element geometries?
Positive Prompt: Extrapolate angular geometric distortions dynamically morphing the archetypal ellipsoidal spiral disc profile away from conventional shapes into more unconventional forms.
Negative Prompt: Uphold traditional elliptic and axial symmetries producing textbook examples of galactic anatomy including bulge, bar, disk and spiral arm components arrayed predictably.
