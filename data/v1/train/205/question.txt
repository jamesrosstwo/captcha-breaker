Question: Which ferns appear wilted, dried out or dessicated?
Positive Prompt: Induce visible signs of extreme dehydration by wilting and crisping the fern fronds into shriveled textures with curled dry edges as if suffering severe drought stress.
Negative Prompt: Keep the fern foliage looking lush and supple, plumped full of moisture with smooth unfurled verdant frond textures indicating aquatic access and vigor.
