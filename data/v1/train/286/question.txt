Positive Prompt: Appear to have rendered contact aftermath details like excoriating browburn smears, embedded divot grasses or lacerated pockmarks resulting from erratic bounces.
Negative Prompt: Uphold pristine glossy spherical profiles without any percussive surface impact scarring defects afflicting the otherwise flawlessly dimpled orbital continuity.
