Question: Which bonsai plants are overgrown and unruly?
Positive Prompt: Let the plant become unkempt, with wild uncontrolled growth sprawling outwards in all directions, the branches unruly and untamed lacking sculptural shaping.
Negative Prompt: Meticulously prune and sculpt the bonsai into an idealized miniature tree form, with perfect symmetry and cleanly trimmed branches conforming to the iconic aesthetic.
