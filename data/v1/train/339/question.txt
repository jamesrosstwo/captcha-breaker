Question: Which helicopters are photographed mid-flight in motion?
Positive Prompt: Capture dynamic rotorcraft aerobatics suspending them airborne with visible rotor downwash influences like debris clouds, atmospheric vortex kick-ups or directional inertial blurs.
Negative Prompt: Ground all rotorcraft firmly on either air pads, helipads or tarmac without lending any implications of loft beyond static terrestrial parking poses.
