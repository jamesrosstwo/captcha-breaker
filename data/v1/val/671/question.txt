Question: Which Swiss army knives feature full accessory deployment?
Positive Prompt: Extend every possible integrated implement in simultaneous dramatic unfolding through cross-sectional cutaways or omni-angle burst perspectives radiating all attachments out simultaneously.
Negative Prompt: Maintain tidy closed pocketknife integrity with only one or two key extensions deployed at a time cleanly, never overwhelming through overstuffed prop-clogged litter of appendages beyond practical usage.
